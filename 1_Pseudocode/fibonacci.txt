1)  Write the pseudocode for the algorithm
that asks the user for a number and stores that number in a variable
called n. Then the algorithm should calculate and print out the first n
numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

Solution:

request an integer (input) from the user
store input into variable called "n"
create a list of [0, 1]
for n - 2 loops
	find the sum of the final two elements of the list
	add this new number onto the end of the list (append)
end loop
print the list
