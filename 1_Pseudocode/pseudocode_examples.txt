1) An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a
zero value, then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were input

Solution:

request an input (positive integer) from the user
if the input is negative
	print "please input a positive number"
	request another input from the user
if the input is more than zero
	store the input in a list
	request another input from the user
when the input is equal to zero
	find the largest number in the list (could sort in ascending order and select the last element of the list)
	print the largest number in the list

2) An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then returns to their 
arithmetic average
 
Solution:

get a list of integers
put integers into a list
find the length of the list
find the sum of all integers in the list
divide the sum by the length
print the result

3) An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products (in alphabetical order)
that are still left to buy 

Solution:

get a list of groceries
sort the list into alphabetical order (either overwrite or create a new variable containing the ordered list)
print the ordered list

4)  An algorithm that asks the user to enter four numbers, sorts those
numbers from smallest to largest and then prints the sorted
numbers.

Solution:

request the user to input four integers 
store integers in a list
sort the list into ascending order
print list
