1) An algorithm that requests a user to input their name and then
stores their name in a variable called first_name. Subsequently, the
algorithm should print out first_name along with the phrase “Hello,
World”.

Solution:

request the user's name (input)
store input into variable "first_name"
print out the variable "first_name" + the string "Hello, world"

2) An algorithm that asks a user to enter their age and then stores
their age in a variable called age. Subsequently, the algorithm
should print out “You’re old enough” if the user’s age is over or
equal to 18, or print out “Almost there” if the age is equal to or over
16, but less than 18. Finally, the algorithm should print out “You’re
just too young” if the user is younger than (and not equal to) 16.

Solution: 

request the user's age (input)
store input into variable called "age"
if the input is equal to or over 18
	print out "You're old enough"
if the input is 16 or 17
	print out "Almost there"
if the input is less than 16
	print out "You're just too young"
