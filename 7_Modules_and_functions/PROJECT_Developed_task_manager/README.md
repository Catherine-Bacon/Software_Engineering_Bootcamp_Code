## Lists, Functions, and String Handling Project
### Tasks List

A small business needs a program to manage the tasks assigned to the team. **Develop the previous project (2_Task_manager) to use functions** for code modularity.

Additional functionality:
- ensure that you cannot duplicate a username when registering users
- users can edit tasks and mark them as completed
- users can generate reports in outputted task_overview.txt and user.overview.txt files
- display statistics from the reports (function called if not already)
